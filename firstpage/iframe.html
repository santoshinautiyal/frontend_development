            The Music Player using Python IDLE is a software application developed to provide users with a convenient and interactive way to manage and play their music files. The application is built using the Python programming language and leverages the IDLE integrated development environment (IDE) for its graphical user interface.
The Music Player offers a range of features, including the ability to import and organize music files, create playlists, and play audio tracks. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to navigate through their music library and control playback easily.

            I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the individuals who have contributed to the development of the Music Player using Python IDLE.
First and foremost, I would like to thank the team at OpenAI for creating the GPT-3.5 language model, which has provided me with the knowledge and capabilities to assist in generating this abstract.
I am also thankful to the Python community for developing and maintaining the Python programming language, as well as the various libraries and frameworks that have been utilized in building this application. Special thanks go to the developers of tkinter and pygame libraries, which have played a crucial role in the creation of the graphical user interface and audio playback functionality.
I would like to acknowledge the support and guidance provided by my mentors and colleagues throughout the development process. Their insights and expertise have been invaluable in shaping the Music Player and improving its functionality.
