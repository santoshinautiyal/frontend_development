         Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) is a fascinating field of study that involves the development of algorithms and models capable of automatically recognizing and deciphering handwritten characters. This area of research finds immense applications in various domains, including document analysis, postal services, digitization projects, and more. With advancements in machine learning and deep learning techniques, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for achieving accurate and efficient handwritten character recognition.
This project aims to implement a Handwritten Character Recognition system using CNNs in Python. By leveraging the expressive power of CNNs, we can train a model to automatically learn and recognize patterns in handwritten characters. The project will provide a practical and hands-on experience in building a robust recognition system that can accurately identify and classify handwritten characters from various sources.
